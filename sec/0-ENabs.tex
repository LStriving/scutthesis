Typesetting is a long-standing notorious troublesome for the scientific
researchers. The noticeable drawback in \LaTeX{} typesetting is that
control characters and text characters appear in the same time, likely
breaking user to input text. In view of this, we propose a novel combination
of \LyX{} + Xe\LaTeX{} + \LaTeX{} in editing paper. In this way, \LaTeX{}
learnes from Lyx's strong points to offset its weakness, with advantages
of both MS Word and \TeX{} typesetting. In additional Xe\LaTeX{} engine,
based on Uincode, not only improves compatibility but also makes it
more convenient to be used. This work also presents a set of \LaTeX{}/\LyX{}
templates of South China University of Technology doctoral thesis,
in order to verify the feasibility of the combination.
